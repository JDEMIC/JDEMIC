- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JDEMIC, a Computer Science Major looking forward to years of headaches and sitting for hours looking at code.
(Already have an Advil drawer ready) <br>
Coffee is my favorite beverage thats been my best friend since the 8th grade and will sure as hell get me through college. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software Development, Game Development, Web Devopment and hope to take on a bunch of new projects during my journey to becoming a professional Software Developer.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning nothing fancy. Currently getting used to HTML and CSS. Soon will be learning JavaScript!

- ðŸ“« You can reach me on Discord @JDEMIC#6878 

- ðŸŽ® Also, if i'm not practicing coding, homework or anything else that's productive....
